## AIRMamba
This is the PyTorch implementation of the extreme weather-degraded image restoration. The code is based on the PyTorch implementation of the Restormer (https://github.com/swz30/Restormer) and AirNet (https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2022-CVPR-AirNet). We benefited a lot from this.

## Prerequisites

    NVIDIA GPU + CuDNN CUDA ≥ 11.1
    GPU memory ≥ 24G
## Aligned and unaligned videos

To make the regression model perform better, it is usually required that the cross-modal video streams appear in pairs. The following links are the unaligned data and partially aligned test data of WeatherInfrared. The aligned data will be publicly available after the manuscript is accepted.
